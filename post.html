        <p> <span id="git"> GitHub</span>, the developer repository owned by Microsoft, made a little deal of its own
            this morning when it bought JavaScript packaging vendor npm for an undisclosed amount.

            As <span id="git"> GitHub</span> CEO Nat Friedman wrote in a blog post announcing the deal, npm is a big
            deal in the JavaScript community. The company is the commercial entity behind the Node package manager, the
            npm Registry and npm CLI.

            “npm is a critical part of the JavaScript world. The work of the npm team over the last 10 years, and the
            contributions of hundreds of thousands of open source developers and maintainers, have made npm home to over
            1.3 million packages with 75 billion downloads a month,” Friedman wrote.

            As though anticipating developer angst about the change in ownership, Friedman promised that users would not
            notice a difference. “For the millions of developers who use the public npm registry every day, npm will
            always be available and always be free,” Friedman wrote.

            He also promised to update the infrastructure behind the tool, improve the experience and keep up
            communication with the npm community. What’s more, he said the company would incorporate the npm tech into
            the <span id="git"> GitHub</span> platform.

            “Looking further ahead, we’ll integrate <span id="git"> GitHub</span> and npm to improve the security of the
            open source software supply chain, and enable you to trace a change from a <span id="git"> GitHub</span>
            pull request to the npm package version that fixed it,” he wrote.

            Isaac Schlueter, npm founder and CEO, writing in a company blog post, saw the acquisition as change for the
            better. “There are some awesome opportunities for improvement in the npm experience, to meaningfully improve
            life for JS devs in countless large and small ways. We’ll be making things more reliable, convenient, and
            connected for everyone across our vast interdependent JavaScript ecosystem,” he wrote.

            But it’s not just the free version, of course. There is a core group of paying customers too, and Friedman
            indicated <span id="git"> GitHub</span> would continue to support them.

            He also stated that later this year when the registry is integrated more fully into the <span id="git">
                GitHub</span> platform, paying customers would be able to convert their private npm packages to <span
                id="git"> GitHub</span> packages.

            Founded in 2014, npm has raised almost $19 million on a $48 million post-valuation, according to PitchBook
            data. “For six years, in the grind of a startup, we’ve had dreams too big to dare hope for. This next
            chapter is a chance to realize those dreams,” Schlueter wrote.</p>
